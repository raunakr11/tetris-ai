# Tetris AI

## Overview

This project is a Tetris game implemented in Python using Pygame, with an AI that determines the best moves. The AI analyzes the game field and chooses optimal rotations and positions for the falling pieces. <br>
This does not apply any algorithms like Q learning or deep learning, but plans to implement those are underway.
